# 1. Introduction

## What is Purple?

It is a communication device used to send information through light. Unlike radio transceivers, this new design use only visible light to transmit and receive information. 

## Why do we design purple?

Today's computational devices are bundled with various connectivity, most of these connectivity are using the RF as the communication medium.  This has led to a serious RF interference in the daily environment. In order to create an interference-free environment, we use visible light as the communication medium. Meanwhile, controlling low-cost LEDs with ubuiquitous SoCs seems to be a good idea to advance this technology. Hence, Purple is provided as the research and educational platform. The platform can be used in the areas of optical communication, sensing, Internet of Things, Embedded systems, Embedded Linux, Firmware development, Linux Kernel Development. Optical Signal processing. Computer Networking, Multi-hop networking.
